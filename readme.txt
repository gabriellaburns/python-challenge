Python Challenge Homework

For this homework, I leveraged for loops, dictionaries, and lists (among other functions) to analyze the data in the PyBank and PyPoll sections of the assignment. 

My code produces the analysis for both parts in a .txt file and a terminal print out. 

I used Jupyter to work through bugs, so both have a jupyter file, but please note that neither Jupyter file produces the correct code. 

There is an attempt 1 file in the PyPoll folder, which was the first code I worked on. This code produced some of the correct analysis, but not the .txt file. The formatting is also not complete. Please refer to the file main.py for my completed and fully functional PyPoll assignment. 

Thank you!
